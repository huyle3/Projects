Hello, here are my projects that are in python that I did in the past year or so. 
First project was an internship with University of Miami where I created/found the best machine learning model that predicts prostate cancer progression in patients.
I tested multiple different algorithms/ models such as random forest regressor, neural networks, and linear regression. 

Second project was also with my internship with University of Miami where I find the perlexity of gpt-2 on a corpus dataset (data on the internet) and found the 
distribution of the perlexity values.
Then I analyzed the graph and split the curve on the graph into low perplexity dataset, middle perlexity, and high perlexity. 
The goal of this project was to see if a model trained on low perplexity, medium, or high performed better or worse.
This would help create better machine learning models that are focused on a specific task such as in the medical field. 
Perplexity is the measure of quality of language models (basically how many tries it would take to correctly predict next word).


All other projects are little python scripts I made while learning in FreeCodeCamp
